# This file is using an inherited layout

The test layout name is `inherited.html`, check it out.

It simply specifies a `layout` property in the Front-Matter of the layout so that it is wrapped with the specified layout, achieving layout inheritance

This content should be wrapped with a red dashed line because of that.
