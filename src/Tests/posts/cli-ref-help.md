# help or ? command (NuGet CLI)

**Applies to:** all &bullet; **Supported versions**: all

Displays general help information and help information about specific commands.

## Usage

```cli
nuget help [command] [options]
nuget ? [command] [options]
```

where [command] identifies a specific command for which to display help.

> [!Warning]
> With some commands, be mindful to specify *help* first, as with `nuget help install`, because there is a package named "help" on nuget.org. If you give the command `nuget install help`, you won't get help on the install command but will instead install the package named help.

## Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| All | Print detailed help for all available commands; ignored if a specific command is given. |
| ConfigFile | The NuGet configuration file to apply. If not specified, `%AppData%\NuGet\NuGet.Config` (Windows) or `~/.nuget/NuGet/NuGet.Config` (Mac/Linux) is used.|
| ForceEnglishOutput | *(3.5+)* Forces nuget.exe to run using an invariant, English-based culture. |
| Help | Displays help information for the help command itself. |
| Markdown | Print detailed help in markdown format when used with `-All`. Ignored otherwise. |
| NonInteractive | Suppresses prompts for user input or confirmations. |
| Verbosity | Specifies the amount of detail displayed in the output: *normal*, *quiet*, *detailed*. |
