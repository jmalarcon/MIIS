MIIS is a perfect blend between a traditional CMS (such as Wordpress) and a Static Site Generator (such as Jekyll). Get the best of both worlds:

- No backend database or special setup needed
- No need to recompile and deploy after any change
- Lightning-fast, without unneeded bloat

**Set up your Markdown-based documentation system or web site in less than 30 seconds!**


## System Requirements

- .NET Framework 3.5 or later (usually already installed on the server), for maximum compatibility

- Super-flexible and easy template creation, with "includes" support
- Custom properties that can be used in any file
- Powerful "Fragments" feature that allows to assemble contents dynamically from several files
- Define different look&feel, layout or navigation for specific files or folders
